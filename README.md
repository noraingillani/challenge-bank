# Challenge Bank 🧠💻

Welcome to my personal **Challenge Bank** – a growing collection of practice code, problem-solving exercises, and small experiments. Nothing too fancy here, but it’s real, raw, and made with the intention to learn, improve, and share.

## 💡 What is this?

Just a bunch of:
- Practice problems I’ve solved
- Code snippets for fun or learning
- Small exercises to keep my brain sharp

This isn’t a polished showcase — it’s more like a **coding journal**.

## 🛠️ Technologies / Topics

Depending on the folder, you’ll find code in:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Small scripting utilities
- Whatever I'm exploring at the time

## 🙌 Why I'm sharing this

Because:
- I believe in open learning
- Someone might find a helpful example here
- It keeps me accountable and consistent

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or even use these snippets however you like.

Happy coding! 🚀
